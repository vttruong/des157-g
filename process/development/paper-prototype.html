    <p>For the first round of paper prototyping, I was unsure of what my project should look like so I made a very simple layout of the pages I think should be part of the site. The featured pages were the main landing page, about page, share page, and the explore page. I partnered up with another student and tested it out. Although the pages were simple there were still a bit of confusion regarding navigation and where to start. This was an issue to think about before the next round of prototyping.</p>

    <p>On the second round of paper prototyping, I added another page for resources and revised my navigation a bit. My previous partner asked what would happen after people shared and that the end was pretty open. She suggested that I added something for the viewers to take further action beyond just viewing, therefore we thought it was beneficial to add the resources page. Additionally, there were less confusions in this round, but the navigation is still not exactly as I would hope. My partner had navigated to pages in the orders I had not expected. The nevigation of the pages will be review more extensively. </p>
