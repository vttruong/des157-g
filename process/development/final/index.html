      <h4>Hello.</h4>

      <p>Welcome to IMMI, a safe space for anyone to share about their academic experience. College is a complex period where many changes are occurring at once in terms of personal growth and career development. It is a period where many people are transitioning out of their teenage years and entering adulthood by becoming more independent and making their own decisions. However, the journey is not always easy as many are dealing with not only personal growth, but also academic growth. Although it is not apparent, there is a stigma of failure that puts a lot of pressure on college students to excel academically. This pressure does not only put a lot emotional distress on students, but keeps them from sharing their difficulties with their peers and faculty fearing of being perceived as unintelligent or unworthy. </p>

      <p>In my experience of struggling academically throughout the first few years of undergrad, this fear can bring a lot of stress and isolation. However, as I meet more students throughout college, I realized that there were more students out there also dealing with the same fear. As I shared my struggles, they were also more willing to share theirs. This platform allows people to submit their academic journeys anonymously and view other people’s anonymous submissions in hopes of letting students know that they are not alone. I also hope that this platform will also empower them to be vulnerable and share their difficulties with others around them in order to create conversation and change. </p>
