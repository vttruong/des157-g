    <p>My storyboard shows how the user would interact with this mental health focused platform where they can read stories submitted by other anonymous users or to submit their own. This site will cater mostly to students, but others are also welcomed to view or submit stories of their own about their previous academic experiences. Some feedbacks suggested that I should keep the users mostly anonymous only sharing information like age and perhaps their field of study. Others also suggested to add some resources to the site as the next step.</p>
