    <h1>Background Research</h1>

    <p>We often think of borders as physical objects and monuments that are meant to separate or keep people and things out. However, borders exist mentally and psychologically, and they often make people feel othered or alone when they are not resolved or properly realized. My background research will focus largely on emotional borders rather than physical ones. The two topics that I am thinking about for my project are the pressure that students have to succeed and the psychology of venting out one’s emotions.

      Academic performance is something that is often measured through scores and grades. We see it everyday and talk about it casually. However, we often fail to talk about the pressures that students go through to achieve great academic performance. Students think about these academic pressures every day, yet most are unable to talk about their fears, their failures, and their successes comfortably. In the article “The Global Search for Education: On Success” by author C. M. Rubin, “most kids agree that [stress] is coming from all areas including parents, self-imposed pressure, and the schools. If you go further, the kids add college, college admissions, and the media frenzy over status, money and success” (Rubin). According to Rubin, this is caused by a systemic cultural issue around a flawed and miscommunicated definition of success. Sometimes being completely immersed in school work, students are not able to see the negative implications that this stress can give them. According to Rubin, “high levels of stress increase the likelihood of depression manifesting itself” (Rubin). This immense pressure created a border between students and their potential achievement, their peers, and their social connections.

      On another topic relating to mental borders, venting was one of the topics I was interested in. Venting is something we often do in order to release emotional tensions in our head. Whether or not we are consciously aware of it, venting can have polarizing effects. In the article “The Psychology of Venting” by Charity Kurz, Ph.D, she mentioned that “one of the main reasons why we vent is to reduce our stress levels” and “disclosing stress is a coping mechanism” (Kurz). According to Kurz, venting is a 2-way process where one person is venting out and another person is listening to the vent. However, according to the article “If you’re going to vent about your problems, do it right” by Julia Case-Levine, “discussing the same problems over and over again, instead of facilitating a release, can end up feeding our negative feelings” (Levine). According to Margot Bastin, a researcher from the University of Leuven in Belgium, this phenomenon is known as co-rumination, “an excessive focus on problems and negative feelings” (Levine). In a co-rumination study published in 2002 in the journal, Child Development, by professor Dr. Amanda Rose from the University of Missouri, it was reported that “friends who spent time extensively discussing negative feelings reported destructive thought patterns and even depression” (Levine). However, more recent studies have found that co-rumination can also be beneficial in forming close relationships and engaging people more in conversations. Emotional stress creates borders from within and make people feel like they are going through troubles alone without being able to talk about it. Although venting has polarizing effects, perhaps developing a proper way of venting will yield positive emotional release, so that people can resolve their troubles from within and build meaningful relationships.

      Although I am not very clear what kind of project I want to create yet, I know that I am interested on the theme of borders and how borders can be created out of mental stressors. I want to create something that can help people share their thoughts and feelings in a safe environment, so that they can feel like they are not going through it alone.
