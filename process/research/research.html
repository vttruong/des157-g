    <p>We often think of borders as physical objects and monuments that are meant to separate or keep people and things out. However, borders exist mentally and psychologically, and they often make people feel othered or alone when they are not resolved or properly realized. My background research will focus largely on emotional borders rather than physical ones. The two topics that I am thinking about for my project are the pressure that students have to succeed and the psychology of venting out one’s emotions.

      Academic performance is something that is often measured through scores and grades. We see it everyday and talk about it casually. However, we often fail to talk about the pressures that students go through to achieve great academic performance. Students think about these academic pressures every day, yet most are unable to talk about their fears, their failures, and their successes comfortably. In the article “The Global Search for Education: On Success” by author C. M. Rubin, “most kids agree that [stress] is coming from all areas including parents, self-imposed pressure, and the schools. If you go further, the kids add college, college admissions, and the media frenzy over status, money and success” (Rubin). According to Rubin, this is caused by a systemic cultural issue around a flawed and miscommunicated definition of success. Sometimes being completely immersed in school work, students are not able to see the negative implications that this stress can give them. According to Rubin, “high levels of stress increase the likelihood of depression manifesting itself” (Rubin). This immense pressure created a border between students and their potential achievement, their peers, and their social connections.
