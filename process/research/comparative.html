    <p>Vent is a Melbourne mobile based application created by Dean Serroni and his co-founder. Vent is described as “a social diary for your feelings” according to the company. It helps you connect with people who share the same feelings as you and
      provides a safe space for you to vent out your feelings and troubles. The platform is semi anonymous meaning the users would have a choice who they are sharing their information with. Its interface is similar to the interface of the popular
      social media application, Twitter. It allows the random users to like or comment on each other’s posts. Vents are categorized so users can even search for vents depending on their mood. In addition, users can also have private chats which
      allows one on one interactions between users. Initially, the application is free, but there are some in-app purchases which unlocks more features for paying users.</p>

    <p>Overall, the interface of this application is fairly simple and intuitive because it is modeled off of other popular social media applications therefore it would be familiar to most users. The layout is flat, simple, and colorful which is
      appealing to the eyes. The categories are clearly defined for users through the color palette chosen. At first glance, I think that this is a pretty neat concept. However, after thinking more about it, I believe that this is no different from
      another form of social media. It reminds me of people ranting on Twitter or Facebook but with an added element of semi-anonymity. Perhaps it could be therapeutic to vent to strangers, but I think it is no different to platforms that already
      exists. There are no significant features that would attract many users to the app.

    <p> eXHALeR is a breathing application created by Hamilton Cline for a wide variety of users who are seeking for guidance when breathing. It seeks to promote breathing and meditation. This breathing app is especially useful for those dealing
      with anxiety and needs visual guidance to help them with breathing exercises. At first glance, the interface of the app is quite simple with just a circle reducing and expanding inside with words of guidance to inhale and exhale. The circles
      also slowly change colors for a visually appealing effect which is delightful to the user. At the top right corner, there is another tab that slides in when pressed. This tab acts as a control center that allows the users to change different
      features of the app such as how long they can inhale and exhale or how long they have to hold their breath in between each inhale and exhale. The users can also use pre-programmed breathing techniques. In addition, the user can also adjust
      audio, the words, and which mode it is in.</p>

    <p>Overall, this breathing application is fairly simple to use and straightforward for any user to interact with because the interface is very minimal. This minimalistic layout is also ideal because it allows the users to relax and solely focus
      on the breathing monitor. However, the control tab is a bit hidden and should be more visible for users, especially to those who are seeking this application during urgent moments. This application is a bit outdated with many informational
      tabs left blank. It could provide more resources to deepen the experience and perhaps bring more awareness to how breathing can help people. Although there is still some more development that could be done in the future, I think that it is a
      solid breathing application. It does not include too many fussy details that could be distracting to the users. In terms of accessibility, it is free and available to everyone with internet access.
