    <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
    <p>The encompassing topic of this project is the issue of mental health and how it is affected by academic pressure and isolation. My project is a submission based platform that will allow users to anonymously submit their academic journey as well as read about the journey of others. This project not only allow people to partly de-stress, but also to let them know that they are not alone and that their struggles are valid. The main message of this project is to create conversation and encourage people to seek for help instead of going through it alone. </p>

    <h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
    <p>The target audience for this project are students, especially those who are currently in school and dealing with stress and anxiety from school and academic growth. The targeted age range would be approximately, but not limited to 17 - 23 years old. This project is especially geared towards students who are afraid of speaking about their academic struggles fearing judgement from their peers and family. </p>

    <h2>Goals of the Project</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project is that it will help people, mainly students, feel more at ease about sharing their personal struggles and know that their struggles are valid. Everyone has their own academic struggles which are often not expressed due to fear of being judged or feeling inadequate compared to others. This project aims to create a safe space for conversation, so that users can freely share their current thoughts. I believe that conversation is one of the first steps towards progress. I hope that by seeing people share their struggles and how they overcame it, users can also feel encouraged and less isolated. It is a starting point for users to confide to their peers and seek out resources that can help them overcome their struggles.</p>

    <h2>Goals for the Overall Look and Feel</h2>
    <p>The goals for the overall look and feel of this project is to include simple flat graphics with bolder colors and muted colors as the background. Throughout the site, there will be flat illustrations present as the main visual element. The stories submitted will be displayed on one page and will be represented by a small graphic element such as a window or a thought bubble where users can click on to read each story. The main typefaces that will be utilized are san-serifs such as Monserrat for the headlines and Roboto for the body text. The overall visual look and feel for this project is a bright and comforting space that has graphic elements related to education. These visual strategies will make the users feel at ease while navigating through the site.</p>
