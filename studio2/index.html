    <h2>Water Bottle</h2>
    <p>This water bottle is quite literally my life source. I carry this bottle with me everywhere I go in order to stay hydrated. Since this bottle in vacuum sealed, it can keep drinks hot or cold for a long time and I also don't have to worry about anything spilling. The pastel blue color is also one of my favorite things about it. I can spot my bottle from anywhwere and it reminds me to keep drinking water throughout the day.</p>

    <h2>Computer</h2>
    <p>My personal computer is a really important tool for me as a student and a designer. This computer has a nice and large screen which allows me to work from anywhere. It is a bit heavy to carry around, but I don't think I can go to class without it. During my free time, I also use it to do some relaxing activities like watching shows or browse the web.</p>

  <section id="mouse-overlay">
    <h2>Mouse</h2>
    <p>This mouse have helped me through many projects. When I first started taking design classes, I underestimated how long it would take to make edits and vectors using only my trackpad. It took very long to complete tasks. However, after I got this mouse, my workflow became more efficient and less straining on my wrist. This mouse is also super quiet too which is a big plus!</p>
